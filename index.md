## About Me

I am Varun, a researcher at TU Delft specializing in motion perception and motion sickness modeling.

Motion sickness is a upcoming is due to the increased prevalance of AVs which move users from being drivers to passengers which increases the probability of getting motion sick. This is a crtical issue for the acceptance and safety of users.
My mission is to enhance human comfort and safety in vehicles.

I embody patience, respect, and integrity â€” values that guide my research and personal pursuits.<br />
My reasearch as a specialist in human comfort needs patience to carry out experiments with humans.<br />
My passion for climbing mountains reflects these qualities, as it demands patience for the ascent, respect for nature, and integrity in overcoming challenges.

I am eager to collaborate with others to innovate and make a meaningful impact in this field.
