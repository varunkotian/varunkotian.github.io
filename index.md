## About Me

Experienced researcher and engineer with expertise in vehicle dynamics, motion perception, and robotics. 

Specializing in large-scale human experimentation and modelling human responses.

Excited about improving automated driving systems and enhancing user experiences.

My passion for climbing mountains reflects my qualities as it demands â€”

patience for the ascent, respect for nature, and integrity in overcoming challenges.

Looking forward to collaborating with others to innovate and make a meaningful impact.
